### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm david072, a 16 year old student from Germany who likes to code whatever he's interested in at the moment ðŸ˜„.

I'd say I currently like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) the most, but I also have a lot of experience building mobile apps using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).
I've also recently started looking into [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity), which I'm having a lot of fun contributing to.

My biggest project so far is an app for fencers, which makes participating in tournaments much easier! You can check it out at [cofence-app.com](https://www.cofence-app.com).

I've also made [funcially](https://github.com/david072/funcially) - a calculator working purely with text inputs, allowing you to write complicated calculations much easier! 
(it's very much work in progress though and I'm not particularly happy with the architecture yet...)
